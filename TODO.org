** DONE On-start                                                  :abandoned:
- control-host checks what components to run @ startup inside the container
- initContainer *could* have this
  #+BEGIN_SRC
wash openapi2mcp <file>
  #+END_SRC
- We shouldn't do this, instead they will deploy from a repo
** TODO Wire up blobstore
- The host that starts needs wasi:blobstore as the MCP server will use it 
* TODO For demo of wash plugin
* TODO Future features
** TODO State saving via a message bus
- Keeping all incoming/outgoing messages via a wasi:messaging plugin (Kafka)
- This is a lever for value-added observability/repeatability/training
